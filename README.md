## [WEEK 1](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/tree/main/Week%201)<span id="w1"></span>

[Q1](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/blob/main/Week%201/find_max.cpp) Given an integer array, present three different logic to find MAXIMUM in an array. For each logic, count the number of comparisons incurred to return MAX. 

[Q2](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/blob/main/Week%201/neither_min_nor_max.cpp) Given an integer array, present a logic to output an element which is neither maximum nor minimum. 

[Q3](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/blob/main/Week%201/prime_factors.cpp) Given a number, write an algorithm to list all its prime factors.

[Q4](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/blob/main/Week%201/gcd_lcm.cpp) Given two integers (m,n), present three different approaches to find GCD(m,n) and LCM(m,n). Make an attempt with the logic of Q3 for one of the approaches.

## [WEEK 2](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/tree/main/Week%202)<span id="w2"></span>

[Q1](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/blob/main/Week%201/find_max.cpp) 

Input: Integer Array A and an integer p  
Question: Does there exist q and r in A such that p=q+r

Propose three different logic and implement all three. Use system time function and compare system time for each logic. Test drive on at least 20 different inputs and plot the graph. Is it possible to call 'excel' from C/C++ program to plot the graph. If yes, make an attempt. Identify which logic is efficient through system time.

[Q2](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/blob/main/Week%201/neither_min_nor_max.cpp) 

Input: Accept a large sized integer array from the user with the following constraints  (i) user should not enter the size of the array  (ii) user should not enter -1 as it is used delimiter. User enters until some time after which the user must enter -1 only and no other integer, the user can enter -1 any number of times.

Question:  Identify the position of the first '-1'

Propose three different logic and implement all three. Like the above, compare system time to pick the best. As a programmer, you may declare an array of size, say, 10000. ( if the system is not accepting, then make it 5000). You should not run a forloop for 10000 or 5000. The size is given only for modelling purposes, in theoretical sense, the size is unknown to the user.

[Q3](https://github.com/HarishShan23/daa_codes/blob/main/Week%201/prime_factors.cpp) Print the following five patterns.
